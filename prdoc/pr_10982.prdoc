title: Meta Transactions - Benchmarking update
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Update of benchmarking logic to remove possibility of `quadratic complexity` not being weighted when executed. Instead of one nested call, nest calls to `MAX_EXTRINSIC_DEPTH` and reserve those funds until meta-tx is executed.

    Update of weight annotation to `saturating add` instead of `add`.
