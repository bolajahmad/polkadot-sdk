title: 'FixedPoint: Add support for `x.y` parsing'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    Adds support for parsing `x.y` to `FixedPoint` numbers.

    Note that this is different from `from_str` which parses the number as `type INNER` and constructs a new value.

    ```rust
    FixedU128::from_str(100) == 100 / 10^18
    FixedU128::from_float_str(100) = FixedU128::from_u32(100)
    ```
