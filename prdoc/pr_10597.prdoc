title: 'Introduce pallet-dap-satellite with fungible currency wrappers'
doc:
- audience: Runtime Dev
  description: |-
    This PR introduces pallet-dap-satellite, allowing system chains different from AssetHub
    to collect funds (to be periodically sent to DAP on AssetHub in future PRs) instead of
    burning them directly.

    **Changes:**

    - **pallet-dap-satellite**: New pallet with `SatelliteCurrency<T>` wrapper that implements
      all fungible traits, delegating to the inner currency but redirecting `burn_from` to the
      satellite account.
    - **pallet-dap**: Added `DapCurrency<T>` wrapper (same pattern) for AssetHub.
    - DAP and DAP satellite funds are excluded from `active_issuance`.
    - Redirect all burns to DAP or DAP satellite on Westend chains
    - Fee split set to 100% DAP on Westend chains

    **Usage:**

    Runtimes that want burns redirected to DAP/satellite should use the currency wrapper:
    ```rust
    // On AssetHub:
    type NativeBalance = pallet_dap::currency::DapCurrency<Runtime>;

    // On other system chains (Coretime, Collective, People, BridgeHub, RelayChain):
    type NativeBalance = pallet_dap_satellite::currency::SatelliteCurrency<Runtime>;
    ```

    Other pallets using `T::Currency::burn_from` will use the wrapper's redirected behavior.
    The pallet-balances extrinsics (like `burn`) continue to use standard burn semantics.
