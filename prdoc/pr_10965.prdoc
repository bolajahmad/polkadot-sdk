title: 'fatxpool: Do not remove listener for finalized view'
doc:
- audience: Node Dev
  description: |-
    Instead of immediately removing the listener for finalized view, lets keep them around while the view is still in the `active_views`. Once the next block is finalized, we will remove it. This should fix manual-seal problems where new blocks are immeditaly finalized.
